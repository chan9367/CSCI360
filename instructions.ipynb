    "## Using AES encryption in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "### Due 10/22/19\n",
    "\n",
    "Below you will see a simple example of how to use AES for encryption in Python.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is one of the most widely used and secure ciphers.\n",
    "\n",
    "AES is a _block cipher_ meaning that it encrypts data block by block. A _block_ for AES is 128 bits of information (16 bytes).  This is about 16 keyboard characters (or about 5 pixels) worth of information.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The details of what AES does to a block of data to encrypt it is a little complicated, but it basically involves repeatedly making substitutions in the bytes (like our substitution cipher) and then mixing the bytes around.  Exactly what comes out also depends on the _key_ which is mixed into the data during the encryption process.  \n",
    "\n",
    "A block cipher like AES usually requires a mode of operation.  Again this is beyond the scope of our project but the curious can read the Wikipedia page below.  \n",
    "\n",
    "[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher_mode_of_operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher_mode_of_operation)\n",
    "\n",
    "The goals of the block cipher modes are to blur the statistical relationship between the plaintext and the ciphertext, and also to ensure that if a message is encrypted twice with the same key then different ciphertexts come out.\n",
    "\n",
    "That's possible because in addition to the _key_ the block cipher takes an initialization vector (IV) which is a random number associated with a single encryption.  It does not need to be kept private.  \n",
    "\n",
    "There are a lot of libraries for doing cryptography in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "The library we will use is called [pycrypto](https://pypi.org/project/pycrypto/).  \n",
    "\n",
    "The basic usage is demonstrated below.  Ciphertext is not printable (because it involves random bits which do not render as normal characters.)  We print the ciphertext out in a few different ways to give you a feel for what it is.  In a Python byte string '\\xAA' is the hexadecimal number AA, '\\x10' is the hexadecimal number 10, etc.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes the ciphertext is printed as a mix of printable characters and hex numbers.  For example the following is a ciphertext:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ';\\x9a~2|\\x187\\x83v\\x07p?\\x93\\x19,z\\x83\\xd6\\xdd\\x12\\xff\\xf5`\\xa2J\\x11E\\xa1m~-\\xa8'\n",
    "   \n",
    "Where possible the characters are printed (eg ';' 'a' '~'  etc).  When I non-printing character is encountered the hex is printed instead (eg 0x9a 0x18 0x83 etc).   \n"

    "The goal of this project is to create a standalone command line tool which encrypts and decrypts files.  You already have the basic parts:  File IO and functions for encrypting and decrypting messages. You just need to put all of these parts together.  \n",
    "\n",
    "You should have absorbed a bit about how Python works in the above.  You can watch this video for a little more info:\n",
    "\n",
    "[Python in 10 Minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxXTHGRtXXs&lc=z23qcnhq1ujpfxgnkacdp43axgdsz4tk00mduure3nhw03c010c)\n",
    "\n",
    "Two things about that video:  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. You don't need to install Python if you're using Cocalc.  \n",
    "1. That tutorial is for Python 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main practical difference between Python 2 and Python 3 is that print statments look a little different:\n",
    "\n",
    "Python 2:\n",
    "\n",
    "    print \"hello, no parens!\"\n",
    "    \n",
    "Python 3:\n",
    "\n",
    "    print(\"Oh no, I have to use parentheses!\")\n",
    "    \n",
    "#### A Standalone Program\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is how you create a standalone program in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "**First** Create a new file with the name you want your program to have.  Please call your program for this project `encrypt360`.  \n",
    "\n",
    "From the command line you can do this by entering:\n",
    "\n",
    "    $ touch encrypt360\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "**Second** Modify the file permissions for this file so that it is executable. You do this using *chmod* as follows (from the command line):\n",
    "\n",
    "    $ chmod u+x encrypt360\n",
    "\n",
    "This says \"allow the user to execute the file named encrypt360.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Third** Add the following line to the top of the file:\n",
    "\n",
    "    #! /usr/bin/python3\n",
    "    \n",
    "This tells the system:  \"When this file is executed, run it using the Python 3 interpreter, which is located in the directory `/usr/bin`.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "To make sure your setup is working, add the line\n",
    "\n",
    "    print(\"Hello world!\")\n",
    "    \n",
    "to your file.  Then execute it from the command line like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "    $ ./encrypt360\n",
    "    \n",
    "This should print \"Hello World\" to the terminal.  (You can delete that line now if the check worked).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Specifications\n",
    "\n",
    "Your command line tool should take 2 command line inputs:  A mode and a filename.\n",
    "\n",
    "The *mode* will be either \"e\" or \"d\" representing *encrypt* or *decrypt*.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The *filename* will be the name of the file to encrypt or decrypt.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For example the user might type\n",
    "\n",
    "    $ encrypt360 e diary.txt\n",
    "    \n",
    "where the command line arguments are 'e' and 'diary.txt'.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the user doesn't include these command line arguments you want to yell at them and tell them how the program works.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is some starter code:\n",
    "\n",
    "    #! /usr/bin/python3\n",
    "\n",
    "    import sys\n",
    "\n",
    "    arguments = sys.argv\n",
    "\n",
    "    if len(arguments) != 3:\n",
    "        print(\"Usage:  encrypt360 <mode> <filename>\")\n",
    "        exit(0)\n",
    "        \n",
    "    print(arguments)\n",
    "\n",
    "Try running this.  This program just gets the command line inputs and makes sure that there are two of them (in addition to the filename which is always given to a program as the 0th command line input).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Robustness \n",
    "\n",
    "You can make your program more robust by checking for other user goofs.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should add code to make sure the following are true:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Verify that `arguments[1]` is either 'e' or 'd'.  If not yell at the user and stop the program (exit(0)). \n",
    "2. Verify that a file called <filename> (whatever the user typed) actually exists.  If it doesn't, yell at the user and stop the program.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The following code shows you how to do (2). \n",
    "\n",
    "    #! /usr/bin/python3\n",
    "\n",
    "    import sys\n",
    "\n",
    "    arguments = sys.argv\n",
    "\n",
    "    if len(arguments) != 3:\n",
    "        print(\"Usage:  encrypt360 <mode> <filename>\")\n",
    "        exit(0)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    mode, filename = arguments[1],arguments[2]\n",
    "\n",
    "    import os\n",
    "\n",
    "    if not os.path.exists(filename):\n",
    "        print(\"File does not exist!\")\n",
    "        exit(0)\n",
    "\n",
    "This bit of code uses the Python `os` module to check that the filename given as the 2nd input by the user refers to a file that really exists.  If the file does not exist, the program shuts down.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Real Job\n",
    "\n",
    "Now it's time to add the \"guts\" to your program:  the encryption and decryption.  \n",
    "\n",
    "You may or may not want to copy the functions you wrote in cell 18 above into `encrypt360` so that you can use them in your code.  You can just put them at the top (but below the #! line).  You will also need `pad` and `unpad` from cell 6 above.  You will also need to add the line\n",
    "\n",
    "    from Crypto.Cipher import AES\n",
    "\n",
    "at the top of your program (above the functions but below #!).\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, borrow code from cell 27 above to actually implement your program.\n",
    "\n",
    "To name your ciphertext file, just add \".enc\" to whatever filename the user gave:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ciphertext_name = filename+\".enc\"\n",
    "    \n",
    "When decrypting, you can strip off the \".enc\" like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "    plaintext_name = filename[:-4]\n",
    "    \n",
    "Your program should prompt the user for a passphrase as in cell 27 and use this to generate the key/IV.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "Test your program like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "**First** Use it to encrypt a plaintext `pt.txt` that you create.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Second** Use xxd to look at the resulting ciphertext:\n",
    "    $ xxd pt.txt.enc\n",
    "You should see some random looking bytes.  *Do not* open the ciphertext using the Cocalc text viewer (because it breaks binaries).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Third** Use your program to decrypt `pt.txt.enc` and verify that the result is the same as `pt.txt`.\n",
    "\n",
    "(Be sure not to overwrite your original `pt.txt` -- keep a safe copy of that file under a different name.)"
